        <h2>Everything About You</h2><br>
        <p>Well, I tried to find the right words to show you how I feel about our friendship. I only thought one word: awesome. To me, youâ€™re very awesome, more special than anyone else in my life. Happy birthday to you! May every moment of your life be as wonderful as our friendship. I want to say thank you for everything that you had to do on me at the first time we meet, because of you, i learn more and more about how to speak well just like you, i got a motivation from you, and from that too i think i have a crush on you, but after that our friendship is grow apart and im actually kinda hesitating to start a chat with you, i'm sorry for that :(</p>
